### Hi, I'm Stefan!

I am a [software craftsman](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) working as a quality assurance architect at Epiroc Mining Intelligence, part of [Epiroc](https://www.epirocgroup.com/en)'s Digital Solutions Division. I do a bit of everything, if not professionally then as a hobby. From signal processing and algorithm development to full stack web development, some light data science and more. In terms of programming languages, I enjoy variety, but have a particular fondness for Haskell and Rust.

When I'm not in front of a monitor, I like to knit, do powerlifting, climbing, and downhill unicycling, study languages, watch birds, and more.
