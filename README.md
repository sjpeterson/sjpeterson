### Hello!

I am Stefan, a software developer working for [Mobilaris](https://www.mobilaris.se). I do a bit of everything, if not professionally then as a hobby. From signal processing and algorithm development to full stack web development, data science and more. The same goes for programming languages, but my personal favourites are Haskell, Rust and Python. I want to like LISPs, but Haskell has spoiled me.

When I'm not in front of a monitor, I practice Brazillian jiu-jitsu and downhill unicycling, learn (human) languages, watch birds or knit.
